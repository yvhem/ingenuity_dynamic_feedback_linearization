\chapter{Control design}\label{ch:Control}

\section{Objective}
% Design a controller for the Ingenuity helicopter to achieve stable flight and maneuverability under Martian conditions. Choose outputs for feedback linearization.

\section{Relative degree calculation}
% Formal proof of differentiation orders

\section{Dynamic compensator design}
% Explain why it is needed and define its state

\section{Linearizing control law}
% Derive the expressions for l(xi, zeta) and J(xi, zeta) and the final control law u_tilde = J^(-1)(-l+v)

\section{Linear tracking controller}
% Define error dynamics and design the outer-loop controller

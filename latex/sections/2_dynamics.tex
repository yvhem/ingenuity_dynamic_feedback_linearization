\chapter{Ingenuity dynamics}\label{ch:Dynamics}

%For the purpose of designing the high-level flight controller, the total thrust magnitude, $F_{mag}$, is treated as a direct control input. This is a standard abstraction that separates the flight dynamics from the low-level actuator dynamics. In the physical system, the commanded $F_{mag}$ would be realized by a dedicated inner-loop controller modulating the rotor speed and the collective blade pitch, as described by the aerodynamic principles of thrust generation.
